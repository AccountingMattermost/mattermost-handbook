# List of Terms

### **0/5, 1/5, 2/5, 3/5, 4/5, 5/5**

We use “x/5” to concisely communicate conviction. 0/5 means you don’t have a strong opinion, you are just sharing an idea or asking a question. 5/5 means you are highly confident and would stake your reputation on the opinion you’re expressing.

Example: "0/5, I think before archiving a channel a user should type in the name of the channel to make sure they really want to do it" expresses low conviction and indifference in the suggestion. Decision maker should feel free to ignore the input. As another example: "4/5, I think before archiving a channel a user should type in the name of the channel to make sure they really want to do it" expresses high conviction and decision maker may want to ask more questions to understand whether [emotion, assumption or priority](mindsets.md#emotion-assumption-and-priority) is behind the feedback.  

### **Bug**

An obvious error in Mattermost software that is typically a code defect. Changes required to accommodate unsupported 3rd party software \(such as browsers or operating systems\) are not considered bugs, they are considered improvements.

### **COM**

COM is short for [Customer Obsession Meeting](https://docs.mattermost.com/process/training.html?#customer-obsession-all-hands-meeting), which is our “All Hands” meeting focused on how we’re aligning the company to serve our customers.

### Country/Region 

Because the term "country" may be either controversial or incorrect when describing a geographic areas governed by a state-like political entity we use the term "country/region" to avoid any accidental or implied judgement on the independence of a region. If the term "country" appears to be incorrectly used, when "country/region" is more appropriate, please contact info@mattermost.com. 

### Customer 

The primary external audience we are focused on for an initiative, which could be an end user without budget \(if our goal is adoption and engagement\) or a buyer \(if our objective for the initiative is revenue\). A customer does not include internal staff, since staff are not external. 

### Dark actions 

The act of using non-web-discoverable formats \(Mattermost channels requiring login, Google docs that aren't web searchable, Zoom call, email, etc.\) to share non-confidential information or processes. 

Example: Giving someone instructions on how to set up OneLogin for MFA on the community server in a DM rather than writing it into a handbook entry for all new staff to use and re-use. 

Dark actions create [false openness](list-of-terms.md#false-openness). [Open actions](list-of-terms.md#open-actions) are highly preferred. 

### **Dead Tarzan**

Discarding an imperfect solution without a clearly thought out and working alternative. Based on idea of [Tarzan of the Jungle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tarzan) letting go of a vine without having a new vine to swing to.

### **Decking**

A term for shipping something that is far below quality standards. This term is used by mountain climbers to describe falling off the side of a mountain, which often involves a series of failures, not just one.

### **Dev Mana**

A specific type of [mana](list-of-terms.md#mana) for developers similar to “points” or “jelly beans” in an Agile/Scrum methodology. On average, full time Mattermost developers each complete tickets adding up to approximately 28 mana per week. A “small” item is 2 mana, a “medium” is 4, a “large” is 8 and any project bigger needs to be broken down into smaller tickets.

### **ESR**

“Extended Support Release”, a version of Mattermost maintained for a longer period of time that will receive security fixes.

### **Expert Mode \(and Crimson Force Field\)**

When documentation or on-screen text is written for someone with considerable knowledge or expertise, instead of being designed for a new learner. In general, try to state things simply rather than speaking to just the “experts” reading the text.

If something is extremely difficult to understand, and yet still justified in the mind of the writer, we call it “Crimson Force Field”. This term is intended to evoke the emotional response of coming across something that is difficult to understand, so writers of Crimson Force Field material can empathize with the readers. Crimson Force Field is drawn from an esoteric episode of Star Trek and it is unlikely anyone but the originator of the term understands its complete meaning. Crimson Force Field is itself Crimson Force Field.

### False openness

Keeping non-sensitive information that would be helpful for staff and community to know out of public web search through the use of dark actions. Often false openness is unintentional, though after staff members are educated on the topic and empowered to use [open actions](list-of-terms.md#open-actions), continued use of [dark actions](list-of-terms.md#dark-actions) would appear to be deliberate. 

### **HW - Help Wanted**

[Help Wanted tickets](http://docs.mattermost.com/process/help-wanted.html), which are vetted changes to the source code open for community contributions.

### **Improvement**

A beneficial change to code that is not fixing a bug.

### **LHS**

The “Left-Hand Sidebar” in the Mattermost team site, used for navigation.

### **Majority regions** 

Countries and regions outside the United States are referred to as "majority regions". We use this term for a few reasons, a\) we use the word "majority" to remind everyone that the ~300M United States are only a tiny fraction \(&lt;5%\) of the world's 7 billion people \(many American companies refer to the U.S. as "domestic" and the rest of the world as "international" which is counter to the inclusive culture at Mattermost\), b\) we use "regions" instead of "countries" because there are political issues with some locations. 

For example, we should always refer to Taiwan as a "region" and not a "country" due to [geo-political issues](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taiwan#Political_and_legal_status).

### **Mana**

An estimate of total energy, attention and effort required for a task--not a measure of amount of code to be changed or cumulative time needed for a change. 

A one-line change to code can cost more mana than a 100-line change due to risk and the need for documentation, testing, support and all the other activities needed.

Every code change added has an initial and on-going mana cost in technical debt, test case coverages and supportability, which is taken into account in feature decisions.

### **MLT**

The “Mattermost Leadership Team”, senior leadership team and department heads working with the CEO in [MLT meetings and offsites](../../operations/operations/mlt-cadence/). 

### Open actions 

Term for publicly documenting information in a web-discoverable format \(GitHub Issue, Staff Handbook entry, forum post, etc.\) prior to sharing guidance to staff and community members. We prefer open actions to [dark actions](list-of-terms.md#dark-actions). 

### PTO or "Paid Time Off"

Time away from work paid for by the company to staff, including holidays, vacations and approved leaves of absence. See [PTO](../../operations/people/working-at-mattermost/paid-time-off.md).

### **RHS**

The “Right-Hand Sidebar” in the Mattermost team site, used for navigation.

### **Spinmint**

Old test servers that could be spun up on pull requests to test changes. Name comes from low cost URL purchased that was easy and unambiguous to spell mapped onto the servers. 

### **SpinWick**

New test servers that use the cloud infrastructure and can be spun up on pull requests to test changes. Name is a throwback to “Spinmint” mixed with “John Wick”.

### Tomb-stoned

Replacing a web-page with a link to the new page created so that people using the original link can easily find the new page. 

### **YouTweetInFace**

A reference to the major social media platforms: YouTube \(“You”\), Twitter \(“Tweet”\), LinkedIn \(“In”\), and Facebook \(“Face”\). The [YouTweetInFace channel](https://community.mattermost.com/private-core/channels/pre-tweet) is used to discuss social media posts before asking contributors and community to engage with the content. The name is a reminder that our tone and approach to social media needs to be thoughtful, memorable, and ideally bring a smile 

### **Windows Vista approach**

An attempt to add functionality through a massive, complex one-time re-write hoping to improve the architecture, but which likely ends in repeated delays, wasted effort, buggy code and limited architectural improvement \(compared to re-writing the architecture in phases\). This tempting, high risk approach is named after Microsoft’s “Windows Vista” operating system, one of its most famous examples.
