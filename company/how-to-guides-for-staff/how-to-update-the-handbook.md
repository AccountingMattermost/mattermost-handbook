# How to update the handbook

### Guidelines 

* **Be concise \(at least summarize\):** Say what is essential, not more. 
* **Confirm people understand it:** Test out the docs with someone reading them the first time and [savor surprises](../about-mattermost/mindsets.md#savor-surprises).

### Steps

Follow these steps to update the handbook:

1. **Sign-up** - Accept an invite to edit the Mattermost space in Gitbook. Reach out to @jason.blais on community.mattermost.com for an invite.
2. **Sign-in** - Go to [http://app.gitbook.com](http://app.gitbook.com) and log in using your Google SSO credentials. Then, navigate to the Mattermost space at [https://app.gitbook.com/@mattermost](https://app.gitbook.com/@mattermost)
   1. Click "Handbook", which brings you to the homepage:

1. **Verify** - Verify the documentation communicates what you want it to say: 
   1. Have someone who is not in your group read what you wrote. 
   2. Have them then tell you their understanding 
   3. If their understanding is not the same as your intent [savor the surprise](../about-mattermost/mindsets.md#savor-surprises) and then update the draft and repeat the process with someone else. 
2. **Publish** - Finally, to push your changes live at handbook.mattermost.com, find your draft on the left hand sidebar, and click the blue **Merge** button.
