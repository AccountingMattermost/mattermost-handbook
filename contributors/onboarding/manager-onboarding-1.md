# Manager Onboarding - 1%

## People Manager Approvals

1. **Managing and approving** [**Time Off**](https://handbook.mattermost.com/operations/people/working-at-mattermost/paid-time-off#communicating-time-off)**.** Our culture is high trust and results-focused. We want people to take time away to relax, think and come back energized and willing to bring their best self to work. As a people manager, it is important to consistently iterate and define what [vacation-ready](https://handbook.mattermost.com/operations/people/working-at-mattermost#5-be-the-change-you-want-to-see) means for your team. All time-off requests should be recorded in BambooHR. 
2. **Location change requests.** Staff agreements are conditioned upon the region of residence noted in a staff member's contract. Location change requests should be discussed with [HR](mailto:%20hr@mattermost.com) and your MLT member prior to providing written approval. Staff must receive written approval from the Company prior to a region relocation. 

## People Managers **and** People Programs

### **Onboarding** 

Managers should understand People Ops and the new Staff Member responsibilities in order to ensure any gaps can be addressed. 

* Complete the [department onboarding template](https://handbook.mattermost.com/contributors/onboarding/staff-on-boarding-guide#departmental-onboarding-checklists) prior to your new staff member's start date. 
* Assign an Onboarding Peer \(Link w/ description to come\). Managers should ask permission of a potential Onboarding Peer prior to assignment. 
* 60 - Day New Hire Review \(Link with description to come\). Managers will need to select the 4-6 peers to provide peer review feedback. 

### **Performance Management**

* **Performance Reviews.** Managers will be invited to a [High Output Management Managers Session](https://handbook.mattermost.com/operations/people/performance-reviews-50#high-output-management) ahead of writing a Performance Evaluation. You can view the [last session](https://mattermost.zoom.us/recording/play/wqGodNpTSDQ4CdGplq7gvNP3RT6WLI9PjBaTtpqmaqUjUZLUX_xMpJ9tuwBX9miQ?continueMode=true) to better understand how to assess performance the [Mattermost way](https://handbook.mattermost.com/operations/people/performance-reviews-50#what-is-the-purpose-of-a-performance-review).  
* **Performance Feedback.** Communicating explicitly is key in managing remote staff and teams and feedback is one of the most important tools a manager has to set individuals and teams up for success. 
  * Managers should address [Brown M&Ms](https://handbook.mattermost.com/company/about-mattermost/mindsets#brown-m-and-ms) and [Likes and Wishes](https://handbook.mattermost.com/company/about-mattermost/mindsets#likes-and-wishes) timely to ensure expectations are aligned and to maintain asynchronous communication.  
  * [People Partners ](https://handbook.mattermost.com/operations/people#team)can help provide coaching and feedback on how to approach performance issues.
