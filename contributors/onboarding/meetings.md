# Meetings

This section summarizes norms for public and private meetings for the Mattermost community and for Mattermost staff (people paid by Mattermost, Inc.).

## Timezones 

When proposing meetings use famous cities as references for time (e.g. 9am Toronto time), since it's clear and `easy to web search <https://www.google.com/search?ei=8w9nXdn0HMH4-wTH1JrgCA&q=time+in+toronto&oq=time+in+toronto>`__. Avoid using "UTC", as it has been shown to cause confusion.

When selecting a timezone city, use the most well-known city in a country where at least one team member is located. Exception: When possible, use a city where we have an official mailing address, e.g. In Western Americas use Palo Alto, instead of San Francisco. In Eastern Americas use Toronto, instead of New York.

## Scheduling recurring group meetings

Recurring meetings with more than two people should have one or more regular slots on the calendar reserved so that meetings can be coordinated in a straight-forward way.

1. Meetings with internal colleagues should be coordinated by checking everyone's availability in G Suite Calendar.
2. Meetings with external colleagues should be coordinated manually with one internal person coordinating everyone's G Suite Calendars.

For efficiency, when Mattermost works with advisors and consultants who engage with two or more internal team members, we aim to schedule meetings in regular slots (or a collection of regular slots) 2-4 weeks apart.

## Meeting etiquette

Inspired by Corey Hulen's blog article of [6 Annoying Things People Do During Video Conferencing](http://hulen.com/video-conf-peevs).

1. Avoid responding to messages in chat while on a meeting:

  - It can be distracting when someone tries to covertly respond to a message. First, other people on call may hear your keyboard and notice you’re looking somewhere else. Second, if they are in the same channel as you, they can see the message `[User] is typing...` in Mattermost.
  - **Tip:** If you feel the need to respond immediately and are easily distracted, set yourself to "Do Not Disturb" mode while in meetings.

2. Avoid answering calls or checking text messages on your cell phone:

  - **Tip:** Put your phone on silent and place it out of arm’s reach, face down, so you don’t feel compelled to act.

3. Display your video on a monitor with your camera:

  - If you have your video display on a second monitor, it may cause you to look away from the camera, not looking at the camera when talking. It almost feels like you’re talking to someone else in the room behind your computer monitor.
  
  - **Tip:** Either move your camera, or move your video window so they are somewhat inline. Also remember to look towards the camera.

4. Mute audio in large video conferences when not speaking:
 
  - When not muted, others can hear random noises, like a fan running or a loud click-clack keyboard, which can be distracting.
  
  - **Tip:** Set your Zoom meetings to be on mute by default via Zoom settings.

5. Avoid fidgeting uncontrollably or spinning in your office chair:

  - **Tip:** If you’re in a group meeting and not doing much talking, feel free to stop your video.

6. Avoid connecting with your computer but also dialing in via cell phone:
 
  - If you connect with your computer and dial in, there are two of you in the meeting and the voice/video are not synced when you talk. In large groups, there will be a random cell phone number that no one will know who they are.
  
  - **Tip:** If you have a bad internet connection and have to dial in, exit the Zoom meeting on your computer.
  
7. When presenting, increase window zoom size or set Powerpoint slides to presenter mode:

  - Otherwise, the text on screen may be too hard for others to see.

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Why don't new people introduce themselves?**

Not everyone is comfortable with speaking in front of 60+ people. Not everyone speaks clear English. We don’t want the first company-wide meeting to be anxious for new team members, hence by default managers intro them. New hires can opt-in to introducing themselves.

Sprint Planning
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

**Mattermost staff only** - Each team is responsible for its own sprint planning process. Sprints are currently one week long, and start on Tuesdays. Note that teams also share demos and short updates with the whole product team in the "R&D Meeting" (see below).

- Goal: Share demos, reflect on previous sprint, and lock on tickets for next sprint.
- Attendees: Development team members (typically developers and product manager).

Triage Meeting
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

**Mattermost staff-only** - (Triage team - 2-2.5 hours/week) daily at 09:30 or 10:00 (`San Francisco Time <https://everytimezone.com/>`__).

- Goal: To provide consistent review, prioritization and ownership assignment of all tickets.
- Attendees: One dev representative from each development team, at least one PM, QA team, Release Manager, and optionally leads, customer support and other Mattermost staff.

**Note:**
- When tickets are first created, they go to triage to be reviewed for clarity and priority and assigned a Fix Version, Mattermost Team and Sprint. Unclear tickets may be assigned to their creator for more information.
     - The **Fix Version** determines the sequence in which tickets are addressed and triage team is accountable for that sequence. It is the responsibility of the triage team to make sure tickets are clear before they're assigned a Fix Version.
     - When assigning a ticket to a **Mattermost Team**, it gets assigned to a dev and put into the current release's Fix Version and the current sprint if the ticket is time-sensitive for release. Otherwise the ticket is assigned to a team with a "Triage" Fix Version and is later prioritized and assigned to the appropriate people within that team.
     - The **Sprint** determines the time frame within which a dev is responsible for fixing the ticket.

- If you're ever unsure about a ticket (if it's not clear, or doesn't seem appropriate) add a comment and add triage to the Fix Version field, which will trigger a review by the triage team in 1-6 working days.
     - **Note:** If the ticket is already assigned to a team, it will not appear in the triage query - easiest is to let the triage team know about the ticket so that it won't be missed.

Procedure:

1. (Attendees): Join Zoom meeting link in calendar invitation at scheduled time.
2. (Attendees): Review `query for tickets needing triage <https://mattermost.atlassian.net/browse/MM-8015?filter=15011>`__ and assign a development team, sprint, and fix version.

Leads Meeting
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

**Mattermost staff only** - (Leads - 1 hour/week) Wednesday (13:00 `San Francisco Time <https://everytimezone.com/>`__)

- Goal: Address leadership and process topics.
- Attendees: (Required) Leads from R&D, Marketing, Sales, and Operations.

Note:

- Decisions should go to Leads meetings when there is lack of clarity or ownership, or to discuss special case topics where process is not well defined.
    - When possible, decision-making should belong to the people closes to details.
    - Individual developers or PMs should make most decisions, and raise to developer or PM team if things are unclear, and go to Leads if lack of clarify persists.
- To queue an item for Leads ask the dev or PM lead.
- Leads is also used for cross-discipline Q&A.

    - Rather than randomize individual contributors, cross-discipline discussion (e.g. marketing to PM, community to dev, etc.) can happen in leads.

Procedure:

1. (Leads): Queue items in Leads channel for discussion.

2. (Leads): During meeting discuss agenda items in sequence.

R&D Meeting

Meeting Elements
----------------

Here we summarize meeting elements that can be re-used for meetings across teams.

Ice-breaker
^^^^^^^^^^^

- 2-3 minute exercises designed to learn more about colleagues at the start of a recurring meeting.
- Typically rotates in random order with names pulled from the `R&D Meeting Ice-breaker List <https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1dCgKFdYkaDYd7yzgbK2VcqscZ1Ni5uNnnkZZv63XtOg/edit#gid=0>`__, three colleagues per meeting (2 R&D staff, 1 'other' (e.g. Sales, Ops, etc).

- Examples:
   - "Hobby talk" - Sharing about an interesting hobby, past or present.
   - "My home town" - Sharing something interesting about where you grew up.
   - "Two truths and a lie" - Share two true facts about yourself and one lie, team guesses which is the lie.
   - "Questions" - e.g. "What would constitute a “perfect” day for you?"
   - Need further inspiration? Take a look `here <https://medium.com/signal-v-noise/the-25-most-popular-icebreaker-questions-based-on-four-years-of-data-893df9b27531>`__.

Blind spots, Inspiration, Knowledge Share
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

- Exercise to find blindspots in team thinking at the end of a meeting.
- Items for team discussion can also be queued in this section.
- Colleagues share areas of concern and ask questions which invariably disclose blind-spots or are an opportunity to improve communication.
- Examples of questions:
    - "What's the status on X?" // often an important item that got forgotten.
    - "Who owns X?" // reveals need for more clarity or communication.
    - "Why do we do X?" // let's us verify if a process is needed, and if we're handling it the right way.
