# Consulting Advisers

To provide guidance, coaching and development for senior and functional leaders, we bring in experts to advise in key areas. 

Meetings typically take place over phone or video calls. We bring on advisers with [standard consulting agreements](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1G4wFLq_wHHEDJ-hrv5Kmu022mFJgh3rJ4-glM0W6riI/edit#heading=h.pwxwwq4ezzfx) on either a time and materials basis or a recurring fee. Typical engagements are 1-5 hours a month, which may range from "office hours" to as needed consulting and projects. 

We use a range of advisers from senior board-level contributors to operational and subject-matter experts: 

* **Consulting advisers** - Director-level subject matter expert 
* **Consulting executives** - Executive with extensive experience at growth stage or public company in one or more strategic domains. 
* **Senior consulting executives** - Public company C-suite on senior leadership team
