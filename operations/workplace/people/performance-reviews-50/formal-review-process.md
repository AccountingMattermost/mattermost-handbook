# Formal Review Process

1. **Confirm level expectations for roles are up to date.** If any level descriptions need to be updated or written, complete it before the review cycle begins. 
2. **Manager preparation.** Before each review cycle, managers read the performance review chapter in High Output Management. After reading the chapter, any new managers have 30 minutes scheduled with the CEO to discuss it and set expectations for the review process. 
3. **Feedback panel requests.** Suggest peers to your Manager by providing [names of 3-6 teammates](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSc_EoF9SUvQNA_Je9VdaZ7W54a-_kSfGG03Y-37AaABpnst_Q/viewform) who you feel can most effectively provide feedback on your achievements and performance over the past year \(okay to include community members in addition to staff\). Your Manager may adjust the peer nominations prior to the panel being finalized. 
4. **Feedback panel selection.** Your manager will take your input along with other managers’ input to select teammates and community members from the list provided to give feedback on your performance.
5. **Peer feedback.** Your teammates will receive a request to complete [annual review feedback survey](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1JNlDCAOgUjjLSJj5EoNe7Pl5kqN6KN7LaEIlM5L9LXw/edit) and to complete the form in two weeks. On average, teammates should be completing feedback surveys for 3 to 6 of their teammates. 
6. **Self reflection.** You are requested to complete [the feedback survey](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1ubNB9duV0YShDt7PYWDpjtHkSj6nFJl4HGCLqWpRjwQ/edit) for yourself within 2 weeks as well. 
7. **Review compilation.** Performance review manager will collect all reviews and share them with the staff member’s manager.
8. **Draft of annual review.** Your manager will read all feedback from the surveys and incorporate their own observations. They will then draft performance reviews based on company values, expectations of your role, and your performance relative to your teammates. 
9. **Calibration.** Managers meet to review and discuss feedback and assessments to ensure consistency in evaluation against the criteria for your role and level. HR will review performance, role expectations and analysis of local market compensation rates and recommend any adjustments to compensation. 
10. **Review discussion.** You and your manager will meet to discuss your achievements in the past review period, the peer, self and manager feedback, any compensation changes recommended by HR, and opportunities to further grow and develop.
