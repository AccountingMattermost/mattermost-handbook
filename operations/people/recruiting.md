# Recruiting

## Hiring in existing U.S. States 

We support hiring in the following U.S. states: 

* CA CO FL IN KS MA MD MI MO NJ NV NY OH OK PE SC TN TX UT VA WA WI

## Hiring in new U.S. States

Each time we hire in a new U.S. State we may be subject to new regulations, taxes and reporting obligations and we need time to prepare for compliant operations in new states ahead of doing business in state, which begins when we employ a new hire. 

For U.S. states not on the above list, the recruiting team should provide at least 3 weeks notice ahead of a potential offer signing date that a new state would be added. 

To add a new U.S. State please DM @tim.quock to provide finance advanced notice and if a lead time of more than 3 weeks may be needed.
