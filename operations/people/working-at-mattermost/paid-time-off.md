# Paid Time Off

## **Results-Focused Time-off**

Our culture is high trust and results-focused. We want people to take time away to relax, think and come back energized. This  page is written with a focus on vacation time off. If you need to take time off for medical needs, whether physical or mention, you should follow the appropriate process in your location. If you are taking Pregnancy or Parental Leave, please see Leave Policies. 

### **Communicating Time Off**

#### When you take time-off, please remember:

1. Discuss with your manager the dates you plan to take off, and decide who will be your backup.
2. Add your time off to BambooHR 
3. For meetings you’ll miss, message the chair with any status updates.
4. Post in the [Stand-up channel](https://community.mattermost.com/private-core/channels/stand-up) the dates you’ll be away and who’ll be your backup.
5. Block off time in the shared [Mattermost Timeoff calendar](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/embed?src=mattermost.com_mg3nulgf6e70e50ohlq2rrkcnc%40group.calendar.google.com&ctz=America%2FLos_Angeles), so it’s easy for the team to see who is going to be away.
6. Note: Time off reminders will automatically appear in the [Standup channel](https://community.mattermost.com/private-core/channels/stand-up) on the first day and last day you’re out.

There is no limit to how much time-off you can take when your work is meeting or exceeding expectations. We strongly recommend a minimum of 2 weeks per year.

### Holidays

Please take off holidays relevant to your culture, resident country and preferences. When doing so, please follow the time-off process in 1\) above.
