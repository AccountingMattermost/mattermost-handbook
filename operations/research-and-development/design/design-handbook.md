# UX/UI Design Team Handbook

The purpose of this playbook is to provide more details on the User Experience Designer role, processes, and relations to other functions within the organization to foster success for employees in this role. This playbook may be shared with other functional areas so other employees may gain a better understanding of the User Experience Designer role, thereby having a greater understanding for responsibilities and interaction areas.

## The User Experience Designer Role

### Function within the Organization

User Experience Designers are organized within the R&D area of Mattermost; however, they have interactions with all departments and areas to ensure the success of the product the user.

### Strategic Priorities
User Experience Designers are responsible for defining and designing the functional and visual experience of the product based on the strategic priorities. Designers are tasked with ensuring the features being built help ensure the product is profitable by meeting customer and user existing and future needs.

Understanding that each client and user have their own set of specific requirements, use cases, and preferences; a User Experience Designer must understand the needs of the client, user, and the business to help exploit value in the areas that will provide the greatest return for the largest audience. Keeping in mind that decisions should be backed by research including competitor analysis, pattern research, industry standards and past experience.
