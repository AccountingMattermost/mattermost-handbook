## **Guidelines**

### **Monthly roadmap planning**

* Based on monthly OKR check-ins, which are already scheduled
* Monthly **customer use case** **calls** led by customer team \(CSO, support and SAs\), attended by product, to review prioritized list of use cases, stories, themes, and Q&A from product
* **Monthly roadmap calls** led by product team, attended by CSO, support and SAs, to review what's planned for upcoming releases, and Q&A from CSO/support/SAs

### Quarterly roadmap planning \(based on calendar quarters\)

* **Kick-off - 10 weeks before quarter start**
  * Share timeline with PM team + Working Group 
  * _NOTE: This is 1 week after that month’s MLT Monthly Strategic meeting, enabling product leadership to cascade priorities to the product team_
* **1% draft \(align on goals\) - 8 weeks before quarter start**
  * Working Group 
  * Dev Leads
  * Product & Engineering Leadership \(shared during OKR check-in\)
  * _NOTE: This is 1 week before that month’s MLT Monthly Strategic meeting_
* **50% draft \(buy-in on prioritization\) - 5-6 weeks before quarter start**
  * CSM/SA/Support
  * CAB \(in future\)
  * Product and Engineering Leadership
  * _NOTE: Timed before MLT Board meeting; Dev Leads draft OKRs around this time_
* **99% draft \(finalize\) - 3-4 weeks before quarter start**
  * Exec team
  * _NOTE: Timed before MLT Offsite. Also enables PM + Dev Lead to start planning resources ahead of quarter start; Dev Leads finalize OKRs around this time_
* **Live - 1 week before quarter start**
  * Shared internally and externally as needed, e.g. COM

### Yearly roadmap planning

* Not defined, awaiting updates to [MLT fiscal planning](https://handbook.mattermost.com/operations/operations/mlt-cadence#fiscal-year-planning) which is currently at 1% draft
