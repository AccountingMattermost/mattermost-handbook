# Company Agreements

## Who can sign on behalf of the company? 

Company agreements should only be signed by CEO, Ian Tien, after the approval of a [Contract Accountability Owner \(or "CAO"\)](company-agreements.md#who-are-contract-accountability-owners-caos) with the following exceptions:

* If you are on-site and need to sign an NDA to enter a facility you may sign such an agreement 
* The following agreements may be signed by VP Finance Aneal Vallurupalli 
  * Non-clickthrough customer agreements up to $5,000 USD

  * Sponsored open source projects and paid simulations up to $600 USD
  * Unmodified Mattermost-authored Non-Disclosure Agreements

## Who are Contract Accountability Owners \(CAOs\)? 

A Contact Accountability Owners, or "CAO", is a Mattermost staff member approved to review and initial contracts of specific types ahead of electronic or physical signature on behalf of the company by the CEO. 

CAOs by area include: 

* Melissa Warner \(Sales Ops\) 
* Natalie Jew \(HR\)
* Aneal Vallurupalli \(Finance\)
* Tim Quock \(Accounting and Procurement\) 

## What are e-sign completion expectations? 

* E-sign request sent on weekdays before 4pm Palo Alto time should be signed by 9pm Palo Alto on the same day and if sent on a weekend signed by 9pm Palo Alto time on the following Monday provided one of the following is true: 
  * **For e-sign from Mattermost staff member** - The e-sign is sent by a Mattermost staff member and either prepared by or initialed by an approved [Contract Accountability Owner, or CAO](company-agreements.md#who-are-contract-accountability-owners-caos). E-signs sent from Mattermost staff are preferred since they are archived automatically in our e-sign system 
  * **For e-sign from outside the company** - The e-sign is prepared by a non-Mattermost staff member \(potentially a vendor, partner or customer\) and approved by a [CAO](company-agreements.md#who-are-contract-accountability-owners-caos) via email to Ian Tien and Amy Nicol ideally ahead of receiving the e-sign request.
    * Within 5 business days of the e-sign completion the [CAO](company-agreements.md#who-are-contract-accountability-owners-caos) or designee should send Amy Nicol a link to the Box.com URL containing the fully executed signature to confirm the archiving of the contract is complete, since archiving is not automatic. 
      * Note: E-sign requests from non-Mattermost staff are automatically filtered to a spam folder and the spam filter needs to be searched to find the request.
* If the timeline is urgent, or if the e-sign isn't completed by the expected timeline please send Ian Tien and Amy Nicol a Group Direct Message on the Mattermost server to expedite
