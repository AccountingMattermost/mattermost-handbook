# Issue/Solution

Issue/Solution is a tool for increasing clarity, speed and output in teams. This page describes the template and process to be used. 

## Framework and process 

A Issue/Proposal template is drafted clearly stating the problem to be solved and the proposed solution to solve it. The draft is circulated to stakeholders, asynchronous feedback is shared, synchronous discussion is completed, the Issue/Proposal owner decides how to document and/or adjust their plans based on feedback, a decision is made, feedback is shared by stakeholders on the decision, and then next actions are recorded and executed. 

### **Issue** 

Clear statement of the problem we are trying to solve. Drafted by one or more stakeholders.  

Begin this section with _"\[TIME\_TO\_READ\] minutes to read"_ this section in italics, where \[TIME\_TO\_READ\] is an estimate of the time to read the draft \(Issue and Proposed Solution\) in minutes.

### **Solution** 

Proposed solution to the issue, including a list of next actions. This maybe a starting point or a more complete solution, the priority is getting feedback quickly to iterate. If you have multiple solutions, choose one as a recommendation and list the others for feedback. 

### **Feedback** **on Solution** 

A listing of stakeholders and their written asynchronous feedback. This should be written in a Google Doc or other system where simultaneous live feedback can be entered. 

### **Decision**

Decision from the decision owner. Any adjustments or additions to proposed next actions should be documented. 

### **Feedback on Decision** 

A listing of stakeholders and their written feedback on whether they support or do not support. A blank indicates lack of support. If someone is not available, indicate that in their feedback section and seek feedback within 3 business days from the synchronous meeting or their return from [PTO](../../company/about-mattermost/list-of-terms.md#pto), whichever is later. 

## Template

To use the [Issue/Solution template](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1XDgumIgT525mH40dj24K3q_muIzJOVzHY5uVeg5OUkQ/edit) create a copy, fill it in, and follow the process above with stakeholders.
