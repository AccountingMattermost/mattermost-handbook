# Issue/Solution

Issue/Solution is a tool for increasing clarity, speed and output in teams. 

A Issue/Proposal template is drafted clearly stating the problem to be solved and the proposed solution to solve it. The draft is circulated to stakeholders, asynchronous feedback is shared, synchronous discussion is completed, the Issue/Proposal owner decides how to document and/or adjust their plans based on feedback, a decision is made, feedback is shared by stakeholders on the decision, and then next actions are recorded and executed. 

**Issue**   
- Statement of the problem we are trying to solve 

**Proposed Solution and Next Actions**    
- Proposed solution to the issue, including a list of next actions 

**Feedback**   
- A listing of stakeholders and their written asynchronous feedback   
  
**Decision**  
- Decision from the decision owner 

**Feedback on Decision**   
- A listing of stakeholders and their written feedback on whether they support or do not support--assume blanks are lack of support.
