# COM Prep Meeting

During prep meeting for [Customer Obsession Meeting](https://handbook.mattermost.com/operations/operations/company-cadence#customer-obsession-meeting-aka-all-hands), make sure to review the following items:

1. Meeting starts with thematic goal, including the theme statement, defining objectives, and actions the company is taking towards the goal.
2. YouTweetInFace is drafted. This should include a hashtag or an at-mention to relevant accounts to draw attention and spread the word about Mattermost to a wider audience.
3. Introductions for each Week 2 Welcome are confirmed \(either manager introduces, or team member introduces themselves\).
4. Material for each agenda item is reviewed, and contains a link for more information such as a post to a channel, documentation or a blog post.

After the prep meeting, post a screenshot of the final agenda into the [Customer Obs Prep channel](https://community.mattermost.com/private-core/channels/cust-obs-prep).
