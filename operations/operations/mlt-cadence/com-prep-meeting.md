# COM Prep Checklist

This page provides a checklist for the Chair and Vice Chair to prepare for the [Customer Obsession Meeting \("COM"\)](https://handbook.mattermost.com/operations/operations/company-cadence#customer-obsession-meeting-aka-all-hands).

Note: T-minus counts are measured in "working days" \(weekdays, Monday through Friday\) prior to meeting day.

**1 - T-4:** Chair and Vice Chair meet to prepare agenda and actions to prepare for meeting. Vice Chair posts draft agenda to [Customer Obs Prep channel](https://community-release.mattermost.com/private-core/channels/cust-obs-prep) and labels it as 1% draft.

**2 - T-2:** Chair and Vice Chair meet to review agenda. Vice Chair posts draft agenda to [Customer Obs Prep channel](https://community-release.mattermost.com/private-core/channels/cust-obs-prep) and labels it as 50% draft.

**3 - T-1:** COM prep meeting held with Chair, Co-Chairs and Vice Chair and review the following items:

1. Meeting starts with thematic goal, including the theme statement, defining objectives, and actions the company is taking towards the goal.
2. YouTweetInFace is drafted. This should include relevant hashtags to draw attention and spread the word about Mattermost to a wider audience.
3. Introductions for each Week 2 Welcome are confirmed \(either manager introduces, or team member introduces themselves\).
4. Material for each agenda item is reviewed, and contains a link for more information such as a post to a channel, documentation or a blog post.
5. If computer sound is shared during the call, test it prior to the meeting and install  libraries or tools as required.

After the prep meeting, Vice Chair posts a screenshot of the final agenda into the [Customer Obs Prep channel](https://community.mattermost.com/private-core/channels/cust-obs-prep), and copies the agenda into the [Customer Obsession Meeting notes](https://docs.google.com/document/d/16F86k0I_ipjhHofm5pP6yA_dWTNvmA4ZBr_z53_087Q/edit).
