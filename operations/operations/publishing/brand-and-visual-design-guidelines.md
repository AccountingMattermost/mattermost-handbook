The Mattermost logomark is called **"the instrument"**. It represents four tools organizations need to achieve their highest priorities:
- A compass for direction
- A clock to set pace
- A meter to measure output
- A dial representing inputs—the contribution of everyone on the team.

### Logo variations
**Horizontal Logo:** Min size 100x16px

### Logo Usage Guidelines
#### Clear Space
To ensure an uncluttered presentation, always maintain a full X space around the logo. The X height is always the height of the lowercase letter “m” in “Mattermost”. Use the safety area as an invisible border.

#### Incorrect usage
- Do not change logo colors. Use the provided options
- Do not rotate the Mattermost logo
- Do not distort or alter the Mattermost logo
- Do not lockup any other words along with the Mattermost logo
- Do not rearrange elements of the logo
- Do not use the logo at sizes smaller than the indicated minimum size

## Name Usage Guidelines
Using the Mattermost name is generally permitted so long as it’s used in a non-commercial way and does not imply endorsement by Mattermost, Inc.
- Please do not name your integrations or apps starting with, or only using, the name “Mattermost”, as this may confuse end users as to where to find support

Community projects might be named using “for Mattermost”, examples:
  - [GitLab Integration Service for Mattermost](https://github.com/mattermost/mattermost-integration-gitlab)
  - [Giphy Integration Service for Mattermost](https://github.com/mattermost/mattermost-integration-giphy)

Alternatively, community projects may concatenate names containing Mattermost, for example:
- [Matterbridge](https://github.com/42wim/matterbridge) – is a Mattermost bridge connecting with IRC
- [Mattersend](https://github.com/mtorromeo/mattersend) – is a Mattermost integration for sending webhook events

**Exception:** Please don’t use the name “matterbot”, as that is an internal service under development.
