### The "Instrument"
The Mattermost logomark is called "the instrument". It represents four tools organizations need to achieve their highest priorities:
- A compass for direction
- A clock to set pace
- A meter to measure output
- A dial representing inputs—the contribution of everyone on the team.

### Logo variations

### Logo Usage Guidelines
##### Clear Space
To ensure an uncluttered presentation, always maintain a full X space around the logo. The X height is always the height of the lowercase letter “m” in “Mattermost”. Use the safety area as an invisible border.
