# Messaging and Math

Messaging and Math \(“M&M”\) are the components of marketing where we focus.

* Messaging includes company, audience and product messaging and positioning as well as content and brand.
* Math includes revenue marketing, demand generation and campaigns, marketing operations, website, events and developer outreach.

We use the “Messaging and Math” framing to focus investments on the messaging and quantitative outcomes vital to the growth of our business.
