# Workplace

## What is the Mattermost pre-release server?

The Mattermost pre-release server runs the latest builds of Mattermost's software, including all open source code for Mattermost Team Edition as well as commercial code for Mattermost Enterprise Edition. 

It has three objectives: 

* Provide a workplace for Mattermost Staff 
* Test pre-released builds of our core products
* Engage with our [communities ](community.md)including contributors and partners 

**The Mattermost pre-release server is NOT A PRODUCTION SERVER.** It is a live view of work-in-progress and will contain bugs and have occasional downtime.   
  
The server has two teams:

* **Contributors** 
  * Available to anyone who'd like to join the server using either an email and password account \([you can sign-up for a free account online](https://pre-release.mattermost.com/signup_user_complete)\) or a Mattermost staff account, which is set up via OneLogin and requires MFA either through OneLogin or Google Authenticator 
* **Staff** - A confidential space for Mattermost staff requiring a Mattermost OneLogin account and MFA 

You can reach the server at: 

{% embed url="https://pre-release.mattermost.com" %}

The server is also available via the URL https://community.mattermost.com which receives the same regular pushes of partially tested code as https://pre-release.mattermost.com and https://daily-community.mattermost.com which offers daily builds. 



## Channel Naming Conventions 

Any Mattermost staff member can create, rename and archive channels on the pre-release server. We trust our staff to use names that are fast, obvious, forgiving, and also to help our colleagues with constructive suggestions when names could be improved through iteration.   
  
The following conventions are in place for channels with common purposes:
