# Mattermost SEO Best Practices

## Our Goal
Our goal is to be the top solution returned when people search the internet for information on Mattermost. When we create better web-based content than our competitors, search engines position us more prominently, which increases our visibility, increases engagement, and ultimately increases customer adoption.

To meet this goal, Mattermost is working with an SEO company to help us build a web presence thatâ€™s easy to discover, easy to navigate, and best serves the needs of our customers through search engine optimization (SEO).

* What change is being requested?
* Who has ownership of the requested updates per web property?
* What web properties will be impacted by the change?
* What SEO tooling is in place for each impacted web property? 
* How will updates be validated to ensure that SEO isn't impacted?
* What SEO guidance, support, and troubleshooting is available?
