# Images SEO Checklist

Ensure every image added to a web page:

* Has a file name that accurately describes the image content.
  * Correct: `organize-your-sidebar.png`
  * Incorrect: `image.png`
* Has a file extension that matches the file type.
* Is added to the web page embeds the image using the HTML `<img>` or `<picture>` tags.
* Is formatted to include alternate image text using the HTML `alt` attribute.
* Is a commonly supported image file format, such as JPEG, GIF, PNG, or BMP. 
* Doesn’t use CSS to display images that we want search engines to index. 

## Why these things matter
* Generic file names like `image1.jpg`, `pic.gif`, or `1.jpg` don’t provide users or search engines with an accurate description of the image content. This can negatively impact crawl rates.
* Visitors using assistive technologies, such as screen readers, rely on alternative image text to understand the picture being displayed. Search engines, such as Google Image Search, also use this information to better understand the website and return more accurate search results.
