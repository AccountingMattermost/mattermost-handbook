# SEO Frequently Asked Questions

## What is SEO?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is as much about human beings as it is about search engines.

* From a human perspective, SEO is about understanding what people search for online, the words they use to search, and the type of content they want to see. The more we understand the customer’s journey to discover and engage with Mattermost, the more we can connect with the people seeking the solutions we provide.
* From a technical perspective, SEO is about delivering our online content in a way that search engine crawlers can find and understand. This means:
  * Helping search engines find Mattermost content by letting them see our pages the same way a user would see them.
  * Managing how Mattermost appears in search engine results.
  * Telling search engines how to crawl our websites, and which pages shouldn’t be crawled.
  * Helping search engines understand our content including images.
  * Letting search results see our pages the same way a user sees them.

## How do search engines work?

Search engines work through three primary functions:
* **Crawling**: Search engines travel the internet looking for content and code for each URL they find. 
* **Indexing**: Search engines store and organize the content found during the crawling process by adding it to an index. Once a page is in an index, the page can be displayed as a result for relevant searches.
* **Ranking**: Search engines provide the pieces of content that best answer a searcher's question. Results are ordered by most relevant to least relevant.
