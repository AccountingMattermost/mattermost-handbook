# How to create release announcements

### **Goals**

* Get community excited about our momentum 
* Increase discovery of features and contributions 
* Make people feel AMAZING for contributing 
* Everything should be ready to share
  * Every paragraph feels like it's ready to copy and paste into a tweet. 
  * Every person we thank who is on Twitter, we Tweet to them

### **Checklist for review of draft:**

1. Rate each image High, Medium, Low \(Author\)
2. Check for spelling and links for correctness \(Release Manager\) 
3. Check all features PM team wants to highlight are included \(Release Manager\) 
4. Check for technical accuracy and statement of benefits \(PM owners\) 
5. Check all contributors are recognized \(Release Manager\) 

### **Style Guidelines:** 

1. Highlight past successes: Cross link to promote traffic 
2. Links tell a story: Links should indicate the content they lead to without clicking, avoid "read this blog post" and instead "learn more about the incident response alpha program" 
3. Zoom level should be no larger than 100% Zoom---TBD, add guidelines on how to crop and frame with white background
4. Use default Mattermost theme color for all screenshots when showing Mattermost

### **Screenshot ratings:** 

1. **High** - Beautiful, highly compelling, grabs attention in a social stream 
2. **Medium** - Tells a story clearly, readable text, right size 
3. **Low** - Bare minimum to call an image 

### **Contributor's list:** 

* Thank people in the announcement and link to their GitHub and Twitter accounts, if we have them

### One great screenshot a month

* Each monthly release R&D should aspire to come up with a "Hero" screenshot following guidelines to use as the splash image for the release. 

## Do's and Don'ts

### Don't zoom past 100% and pixilate images

When you need to show a particular part of the product, don't crop the image and zoom past 100% to show the functionality.  

Example of what not to do:

### Do show sub-components framed in grey background 

Instead, show the sub-component at 100% zoom with a 12pt WHITE border \(so there is white space\) and a background at 10% grey with no border, so the image is elegantly framed:
