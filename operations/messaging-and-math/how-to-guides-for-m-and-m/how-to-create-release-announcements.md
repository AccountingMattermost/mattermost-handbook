# How to create release announcements

### **Goals**

* Get community excited about our momentum 
* Increase discovery of features and contributions 
* Make people feel AMAZING for contributing 
* Everything should be ready to share
  * Every paragraph feels like it's ready to copy and paste into a tweet. 
  * Every person we thank who is on Twitter, we Tweet to them

### **Checklist for review of draft:**

The Release Manager \(Amy Blais\) owns the release announcement, including the following checklist items unless otherwise indicated:

1. Exciting title
   1. Do not lead with a parity feature 
2. Compelling, specific one-liners
   1. Introduce features with compelling, concise, specific descriptions
   2. If the feature is a filler for a release, be vague and add it at the end of the blog post, e.g. "Performance improvements to mobile". \(Generally not recommended\)
3. Check for spelling and links for correctness
4. Check all features PM team wants to highlight are included
5. Check all contributors are recognized
   1. Thank people in the announcement and link to their GitHub and Twitter accounts, if we have them
6. Rate each image High, Medium, Low quality **\(Author owns\)**
   1. **High** - Beautiful, highly compelling, grabs attention in a social stream 
   2. **Medium** - Tells a story clearly, readable text, right size 
   3. **Low** - Bare minimum to call an image 
7. Don't use any screenshots not rated at high quality
8. Check for technical accuracy and statement of benefits **\(PM team owns\)** 

### **Style Guidelines**

1. Highlight past successes: Cross link to promote traffic 
2. Links tell a story: Links should indicate the content they lead to without clicking, avoid "read this blog post" and instead "learn more about the incident response alpha program" 

### Screenshot Guidelines

### One great screenshot a month

1. Each monthly release R&D should aspire to come up with a "Hero" screenshot following guidelines to use as the splash image for the release.
