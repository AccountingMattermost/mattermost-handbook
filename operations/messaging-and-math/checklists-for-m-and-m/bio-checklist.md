# Bio Checklist

Below is a checklist for Wordpress bios which appear for published posts in https://mattermost.com/blog.

* Each author should have a brief bio so that readers can learn more about them
* The bio should be concise and include:
  * Name and current position at Mattermost or other company if itâ€™s a guest post \(1 line\)
  * Some previous work experience, if applicable \(1 or 2 lines\)
  * Additional information as desired \(e.g., where they went to college, where they live, hobbies, other noteworthy skills/experiences\) \(1 or 2 lines\)
* Authors should also pick a headshot for their bio \(author can submit a picture; otherwise Mattermost will take from LinkedIn/public source\)
