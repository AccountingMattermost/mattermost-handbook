# Messaging and Math

## About Messaging & Math \(M&M\)

Often called "Marketing" at Mattermost we're using the term "Messaging and Math" to convey the focus of what we're aiming to achieve in accelerating the awareness and adoption  of our open source and commercial products. 

The "Messaging and Math" concept focuses our marketing efforts on two priorities: 

### **What is the message?** 

Define the positioning, messaging and stories for our offerings in general and in specifics for personas at different stages in their journey.

### **What's the math to reach out audience?** 

Define clear goals for sharing our message with audiences that would benefit from our offerings and quantitatively advance them down journey stages to ever increasing benefits. 

Things won't be perfect. There will always be things we can't measure well. The importance is setting the intention that we are focused on reaching audiences who can benefit from our offerings in a quantitative way when we can, and be less satisfied when aren't focused on our messaging and our math.
