# Business Operations

## FY20 Business Operations VPMOM \(TBA\)

TBD - Schiff owns updating this.

## **FY20 Standard Operating Procedures \(TBA\)**

Vision

* Operate efficiently with Standard Operating Procedures \(SOPs\) that are aligned, documented, easy-to-use and deliver value quickly

Priorities

* Alignment - SOPs should clearly align to vetted VPMOMs
* Documented - All SOPs found online through web search
* Easy-to-use - Experience of using SOPs is fast, obvious and forgiving
* Agreed - RAPID feedback and agreement achieved
* Delivery Value Quickly - We move faster with SOPs, not slower

Methods

* Table of Contents - Public list and link all SOPs at [Operations section of handbook.mattermost.com](http://handbook.mattermost.com/sop/operations.html)
* RAPID review - Update SOPs with RAPID stakeholder review
* Onboard and train - Include on-boarding, training for new and updated SOPs
* SOP iteration - Measure, monitor and manage SOPs

Obstacles

* Too many procedures stored in email, channels and tribal knowledge
* Too many undocumented, unclear procedures
* Duplicate, conflicted procedure documented
* People not knowing about and/or following SOPs

Measures

* Number of unlisted procedures \(no TOC listing\)
* Number of undocumented procedures
* Error rate by SOP
