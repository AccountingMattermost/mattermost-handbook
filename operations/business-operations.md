# Business Operations

## FY20 Business Operations VPMOM 

Vision

* Make other functions wildly successful by providing stellar support with process, tooling,  IT, and data-driven infrastructure and analytics

Priorities

* Customer Journey (Definition, awareness,  automation)
* Data Infrastructure and Analytics
* MLT level metrics and coordination
* Process Efficiency and Awareness


Methods

* Project Management:  Define, scope, prioritize and implement the right things in Q4 and beyond.
* Customer Journey operations: Define the Customer Journey with functional stakeholders. Build a project timeline to implement process and tooling to support all key CJ milestones. In the short term we will focus on Customer Billings, License and Provisioning (BLP)
* Establish a data and analytics service bureau: Create data and analytics infrastructure that will be used to manage all company critical data. Work with stakeholders to document canonical definitions of key metrics. Establish a self service model for end users. A short term priority will be to begin working centralizing Product Data and Telemetry
* MLT Vision and buy-in: Work with MLT to define and scope key MLT metrics and project milestones
* IT systems operations:  Focus on creating a catalog of all systems used at Mattermost. Identify contract details, spend, owner and users with access. Sunset systems no longer used and/or performing a duplicate function.


Obstacles

* It will take time to fully understand all the needs of the company and prioritize appropriately.
* Lack of common business and technical definitions for key company and functional metrics
* Resources available to tackle key projects
* Lack of central control and standardization of systems. There are a few instances where there is more than 1 system performing the same function.


Measures

* TBD within Q4
* Will be based on project milestones around abopve methods
