#### FY20 Sales VPMOM 

Vision

Obstacles

* Creating awareness in the G2000 to engage
* Prospects won’t talk to AEs for lack of compelling content
* Need actionable info from telemetry on open source users
* Onboarding \(process, best practices, docs and training\)
* Keeping the product competitive and differentiated
* Need top 5 most important integrations from Mattermost \(e.g. WebEx\)
* Meet product the demands of new G2000 customers
* Need to optimize pricing and packaging \(repackage E10\)
* Need for greater bottoms-up interest in EE within the product
